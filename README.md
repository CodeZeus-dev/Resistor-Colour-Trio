# Resistor Colour Trio

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
- Each band acts as a digit of a number. For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.
  In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.
  The color bands are encoded as follows:

* Black: 0
* Brown: 1
* Red: 2
* Orange: 3
* Yellow: 4
* Green: 5
* Blue: 6
* Violet: 7
* Grey: 8
* White: 9
